This tutorial provides an introduction to finding and assembling pre-existing code to quickly create complex models. It uses code and data linked to the https://projectmercury.eu pages. We will create a Roman transport network by reusing existing code that draws on the open access ORBIS dataset (http://orbis.stanford.edu/), we will create alternative network structures by reusing existing code, and we will explore the impact these different network structures have in light of simple economic processes. This tutorial will reveal the importance of not reinventing the wheel, of searching for appropriate existing code and letting your model-building be inspired by others’ previous work.

## Python implementation

A Python reimplementation of this module is available in [`python_implementation/`](python_implementation/romanTransportNetwork_v01.py), providing the same distance analysis and visualisation procedures as the original NetLogo model via the `RomanTransportNetwork` class.

**Dependencies:** Python >= 3.9, networkx >= 2.0, matplotlib >= 3.0, numpy >= 1.20

[`demonstration.ipynb`](python_implementation/demonstration.ipynb): Jupyter Notebook demonstrating how to load the ORBIS network, run all four distance analyses, and produce all six visualisations replicating the NetLogo procedures.

See [`python_implementation/documentation`](python_implementation/documentation/tableOfContents.md) for the full list of resources.
